The current plan is to create snake inside a 20x20 grid(wish me luck)

First create 400 squares
Place 20 squares in a HBox*20
20-HBox in VBox
four buttons in right side to control the snake direction
print out in window

create method for placement of random fruit
if live fruit = true dont generate new
need all 400 squares in []
math.random to get random square
if square is snake part boolean again = true
set live fruit = true
variable to check number of eaten fruit

method for movement
if direction is --> paint current + 1
